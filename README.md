# Cedars-Sinai-Internship

## Goal: 
* Design shim coils to correct the off-resonance created by rectal air around the prostate region
* Improve prostate cancer identification

## Procedure:
1. Load Field Maps (B0)
2. Define region of interest
3. Plot the prostate and the body
4. Generate Coil Coordinates
5. Calculate Bz with Biot Savart Law
6. Derive shim current
7. Shimming
8. Genetic algorithm

## Results:
* Improve prostate field homogeneity by 60%

## function order:
1. Apply_Manual_Mask
2. Plot_Coils_9_vars
3. Biot_Savart
4. Solve_Shim_Current
5. Bz_Calc
