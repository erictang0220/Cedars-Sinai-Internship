# Cedars-Sinai-Internship

Goal: Design shim coils to correct the off-resonance created by rectal air around the prostate region


Procedure:
1. Load Field Maps (B0)
2. Define region of interest
3. Plot the prostate and the body
4. Generate Coil Coordinates
5. Calculate Bz with Biot Savart Law
6. Derive shim current
7. Shimming
8. Genetic algorithm

function order:
Define mask function
Coil plotting function
Biot Savart function
Linear least square function
BzCalc function
